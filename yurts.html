        <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
          <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
              Each yurst is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a
              roof dome that can be opened.
          </p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-box">
        <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
          <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
              gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes
              electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
              restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

        <h3>What should I bring?</h3>

              changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful
              to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
